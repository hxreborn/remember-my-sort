Forces the Android system file picker (DocumentsUI) to persist sort preferences across directories and sessions.

**The Problem**

Android 11+ requires apps to use the system file picker for storage access. This picker resets sort order to filename A-Z whenever entering subdirectories. Users must manually re-sort every time.

**The Fix**

Hooks DocumentsUI sort handling to persist user preference. Manual sort changes are saved and restored automatically. Defaults to date descending on first run.

**Requirements**

- LSPosed framework (API 100+)
- Android 11+ (API 30)
- Root access

**Supported Packages**

- com.google.android.documentsui (Google/Pixel devices)
- com.android.documentsui (AOSP ROMs)

**Installation**

1. Install LSPosed (JingMatrix fork recommended)
2. Install this module
3. Enable in LSPosed Manager
4. Add DocumentsUI package to module scope
5. Force stop DocumentsUI
